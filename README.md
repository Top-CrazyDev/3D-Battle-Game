Welcome to FPS2!

__FPS2__ is a __First-Person-Shooter__ like the orginal ([FPS1](https://github.com/Parking-Master/FPS)). It features a wide variety of customization, in-game experience, and more! Read more to see what the game has.
<br>
<br>
A big thanks to the 3d modelers for helping create some of the items used in this game. Credits are [below](#credits).

### Ok, it's great. But where do I play it?
The game is fully available for everyone to play. The website is hosted with __GitHub Pages__ at:
<p align="center"><a href="https://fps2.uk.to">f p s 2 . u k . t o </a></p>

## About
Why is FPS 2 better than the original?
### 1. Performance
The original FPS was a fun game with lots of Features & Misc, but when it comes to performance, it's not very good.

#### FPS 1
- Choppiness: 5/10
- Battery Usage: 9/10
- Data usage: 9/10

#### FPS 2
- Choppiness: 2/10
- Battery Usage: 4/10
- Data usage: 3/10

If you add all of the lists together, times it by 2, then subtract 100 with it, you'll get the total performance:

__FPS 1__ - 100 - 2(5 + 9 + 9) = 54

__FPS 2__ - 100 - 2(2 + 4 + 3) = 82

Lists are below.

_Note:_
 - "positive performance" means _good_ performance that has reduced lag or uses less resources.

 - "negative performance" means _bad_ performance that has uses more battery life, resources, or is choppy/glitchy.
 
#### FPS 1
- Total positive performance: 54/100
- Total negative performance: 46/100

#### FPS 2
- Total positive performance: 82/100
- Total negative performance: 18/100

As you can see in the total negative performance, FPS2 has almost _no negative performance_ compared to FPS1.
### 2. Style

Obviously, new game can't be completely similar style-wise to the original game, so there is a huge difference in Menus, In-game UI design, and _much_ more.

#### FPS 2:

#### FPS 1:

A lot of responsiveness has also been added not only for screen size, but for touch support and element spacing.
